# 💧 Water Scarcity Management Dashboard - Pakistan

A data-driven dashboard application for monitoring, predicting, and analyzing water scarcity trends in Pakistan.
This system combines Python scripts for data processing and forecasting with JavaScript for frontend visualizations.
Designed to help policymakers, researchers, and stakeholders make informed decisions on water resource management.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project leverages real water-related datasets to generate insights and predictions on water availability.
It currently focuses on regional data (e.g., Sindh) and provides an extendable framework for other regions.

---

## 🧩 Features

📈 **Predictive Modeling** Uses historical data to forecast water availability.
📊 **Data Visualization** JavaScript-based charts for displaying trends.
🧠 **Modular Design** Separated logic for data generation, prediction, and frontend rendering.
📁 **CSV Integration** Works directly with `water_data.csv` for loading and saving processed data.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 🔧 1. Backend (Python)

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
````

Run the prediction script:

```bash
python predicteddata.py
```

Generate sample or synthetic data:

```bash
python water_data_generator.py
```

---

### 🌐 2. Frontend (JavaScript)

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run development server:

```bash
npm start
```

Ensure any JavaScript modules (e.g., `sindhWaterData.js`) are properly loaded into your frontend.
